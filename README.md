As unhealthy lifestyle and health-related problems are are becoming a global challenge for the world, we thought to change this pattern and to help people live a healthier lifestyle. Therefore, we have created a website that will help our customers to be presented with a nutritious and healthy diet plan, depending on their present health conditions and diet. We learnt a lot together as a team about website development and collaboration. 

Two of our members worked on the front end of the program and the other two worked on the back end of it. Our front end programmers created a login/registration page for the first time, which is a challenge in itself, and our back end programmers had to overcome the challenge of creating functions to calculate the BMI and then recommend the diet plan based on it. However, while these were just programming challenges that we overcome, we also faced the challenges of working together virtually for the first time. It is tough to work as a team virtually, but we did it right by communicating well with each other.

At last, this website just brought a bunch of crazy college-goers and a high schooler together, even though we are miles apart from each other, just to revolutionize the unhealthy lifestyle in the world. In the future, we hope to collaborate with restaurants as to have our customers be delivered ready mate nutritious food, depending on the recommendation of our food scientists, and to have a live chat box where our customers can chat with our food scientists and nutritionists. Last but not the least, we will also provide our customers with yoga exercises and training through our blogs.
